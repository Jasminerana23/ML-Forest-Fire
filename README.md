# Forest Fire Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using a machine learning model. The FWI is a critical indicator of fire danger, and this tool helps in assessing potential forest fire risks based on environmental features.

The model is built using **Ridge Regression** and deployed with a Flask web application. Users can input various environmental parameters to get a predicted FWI score.

## Features
### Input Parameters
The model takes the following independent features:
- **Temperature (Â°C)**
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**
- **Wind Speed (Ws)**
- **Rainfall (mm)**
- **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)**
- **Duff Moisture Code (DMC)**
- **Drought Code (DC)**
- **Initial Spread Index (ISI)**
- **Buildup Index (BUI)**

### Output
The output is the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, which measures the likelihood and intensity of a forest fire.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
1. Install **Python 3.x**.
2. Install the following Python libraries:
   - Flask
   - NumPy
   - Scikit-learn
   - Pandas

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishnaChauhan7/ForestFirePrediction.git
   cd ForestFirePrediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myvenv
   source myvenv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
   myvenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
6. Input the environmental parameters to get the FWI prediction.

## Future Improvements
1. Enhance the user interface for better usability.
2. Add more features like geographical data to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Deploy the model using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
4. Integrate real-time weather data for live predictions.
